module MutableArithmetics

# Performance note:
# We use `Vararg` instead of splatting `...` as using `where N` forces Julia to
# specialize in the number of arguments `N`. Otherwise, we get allocations and
# slowdown because it compiles something that works for any `N`. See
# https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/32761 for details.
